#Hello, Pull Request

this repository is used for **review and practice** about "github".
All procedure is done by only me(a double role)

In this practice I don't use **"Fork & Pull Model"**, instead I'm gonna use **"Shared Repository Model"**
Basically, I use github.app or sourcetree.app instead of terminal,commandline.

###Procedure

1. create repository on github
2. clone repository to local machine
3. create new branch and move to it
4. start edited cloned files then push them
5. move to github repository page and check pushed branch data
6. move to Pull Request page and write down description about edited part to explain what you did
7. send your pull request

8. merge **(I will marge by myself for practice)**
9. check contents of Pull Request it's been sent
10. if ok, merge pull request
11. Delete branch button will be shown, so click and delete branch. (the role of that branch has finished)
